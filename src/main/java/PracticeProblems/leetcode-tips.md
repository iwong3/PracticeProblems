# general
- ordering
    - most expensive -> least expensive = fewer iterations?
- greedy?
    - take the best / most expensive at every iteration
- binary search = improvement for sorted data

# chars
- count chars in array, hashmap

# strings
- keep track of longest/shortest substring = sliding window
- palindrome = same reversed
- anagrams = same when sorted (string -> char array -> string)

# arrays
- iteration order: left vs. right
- sorting
- all unique combinations in array
    - start with empty array = ans
    - iterate through target array and add current value to all arrays in ans
    - repeat

# hashmaps
- keep track of all combinations = hashmap to keep track of subsets (speed improvement)
